5. Ask clear, focused questions one at a time
6. Show genuine interest in responses with brief follow-ups when appropriate
7. Maintain professional but warm tone throughout

"I noticed you worked with React at your last position. What did you enjoy most about that?"
"Tell me about a time you had to debug a complex issue."
"How would you approach designing a scalable API?"

Example BAD questions:
"Building on your experience with [technology], how would you [do something]?" 
"Please elaborate on your utilization of [skill] in [context]."

So, but we can combine both in an application. For example, if I give you an example, uh, I did a project, uh, it's name is keys, and it's this way in my resume as well.

The reason behind it was, uh, let me think, because I am currently using the, uh, using this. In my current project, Maysgen. So, uh, for example, if I, uh, have added some, uh, I have utilized socket in my project. That's Nainess Maysgen.

So, let's say, let's, let's more f uh, like give you more familiarity with it. Uh, there's a pen which has been created in Lahore and its price is 10. But if it will be sell- Around 10 in Lahore, 15 in Slamba, 20 in Karachi, because of the freight and everything that distribution charges. So now each city has a different price.

With their own price, like a catalog, they have, uh, three products and both of, uh, and all of three products have price 10. But their base price is 5. Alright. So, then I will- uh, attach that catalog to, uh, specific city or, uh, no, not to a specific city. I will attach that catalog to a specific market and then that market has some specific cities in it. So, let's say I have defined, uh, multiple- markets. Each market has multiple cities, all right. And each market has catalogs and catalogs have the price list and price list is connected to the products. So, uh, the products have different prices in- different catalogs and catalogs connected to different markets. And in markets, we have different cities to, like, in the whole, and craggy. They are in, uh, same market. So, the pen will be, uh, uh, uh, sell there, like, uh, for ten rupees, but, uh, it's not much, I'll put it in the other market. So, there will be another catalog for that, that will have another price list, but we have, uh, the same products will be linked to that, but the prices will be changed, like, fifteen rupees or twenty rupees.

We have the G.A. branches named with the G.R. tickets and there are specific prefixes and specific suffixes. Yes, yes. So that's what I- I was asking. Yes, yes, yes. So these are the flows, uh, these are not the git workflows, these are the flows, uh, git flows. That's how you create a branch, how you create a release, how you create a tag and all of these stuff, so that's came from there. Yes, yes, so, yes, I am- doing this, but, uh, with the name of the terminology, you didn't came into my mind. No, it is, no, it's, no, it is. Okay, so, uh, mmm, that's it. Okay, so, okay, Zad, do you have any question for me?"

We have, uh, uh, guys working on the python node react, not completely angler, but sometimes angler and, And, uh, we have a team that is working on the Shopify and Wordpress, and these kind of things and the design team. And then we are majorly working on direct native node.js. These are the main common ones. And now we are majorly focusing on towards the AI. So that's why we are here. And here comes my next question. Uh, what's the sort of a AI similarity that you already have or not?"

But for the past two months, I have started learning generative AI, and I have learned the basics of generative AI, RAG system, vector databases, how to- how to implement RAG in an AI driven application. Alright, so I did some small projects that have generative AI, that have RAG in it. So I have utilized the- Langshin framework where I used the buffer memories and the summary memories, uh, entity memories for that. So yes, I am working on that. So, my next- next question was related to the AI. I was going to ask you- Nana, we are- we are already working on the AI generated, uhh, part. We have- that's- that's very great for me because I- I am self-learning this and I won't. Okay. So, we are building an application where that, uhh, you might have heard about- this is an AI based interview. So, we are trying to automate this AI journey of anyone's interview into the AI journey. And at the AI- so, right now, we have just almost ready. We are working on a feedback- how to generate a feedback based on each year of experience. So, that is what we are working- right now. So, what tools you do, do you know about the Agentic AI?"
